<p>Here i made a News site using  <a href="https://newsapi.org/">News Api</a></p>
<p>First i created a proxy server which will fetch the data(main article) from the API and send it back to the site by this i can secure my API key too(i hope so)





👀 i know site lack some UI like search but i made this site just for practice purpose  to solve cors T_T i may or may not  add some additional buttons like a search buttons hehe 😏
